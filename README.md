# Brick-Braker
# A 2D Game

This program is an interpretation of the famous game Brick Breaker, the point of which is that the player must break a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball from the paddle, which can only move horizontally.
Initially, the player has 3 lives; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player moves on to a new, more difficult level. This game has 46 levels, and also considering that it still has the ability to create your own 30 custom levels. If all lives are lost, the game is over.
In this version of Brick Breaker, it is possible to shoot flaming fireballs and play with more than one ball if the player gets power up.
